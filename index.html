                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; HTML stands for&nbsp;<q><i><span style="color:red"> Hyper Text Markup Language.</style></i></q> &nbsp;It is very useful to make web pages. Hyper text Markup file is a text file containing small markup tags. These marks up tags tell the browser how to display a web page. </p> 
                   <p>&nbsp; It has two types of extensions one is .htm and second is .html but both are used for html web pages. For hyper text mark up language we can use the simple text editor for example; use notepad for writing  HTML code in the windows. For Mac we can use simple text editor. The beauty of this language is that it is not case sensitive.

          <h3 style="text-align:center;color:peru" > CSS</h3> 
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; CSS stands for&nbsp;<q><i><span style="color:red"> Cascading Style Sheet.</style></i></q>&nbsp;The purpose of CSS is to provide Web developers with a standard way to define, apply, and manage sets of style characteristics.

        </p>
         <p>&nbsp;The "cascading" in Cascading Style Sheets refers to how property values are applied in the context of the parent/child hierarchy of the Web document. Child elements either inherit or override property values bound to their parent elements.
         </p>
        <p> &nbsp;For most styles, if a value for a style property has not been specified for a child element but has been specified for its parent element, then the parent's value is used to display the element. On the other hand, if the child element does specify a new value for a style property also specified by the parent, the browser uses the child's value to display the element.

          <h3 style="text-align:center;color:navy" > JS</h3> 
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; JS stands for&nbsp;<q><i><span style="color:red"> Java Script</i></q> &nbsp;JavaScript is a powerful and popular language for programming on the web.JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p> 
                   <p>&nbsp;JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.

          <h4 style="color:crimson"> &nbsp;java and java script</h4>
         <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color:crimson">Key differences between Java and JavaScript: Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language. Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only. Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.

          <h3 style="text-align:center;color:red" > XML</h3> 
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; XML stands for&nbsp;<q><i><span style="color:red"> Extensible Markup Language</style></i></q>&nbsp;Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to describe data. The XML standard is a flexible way to create information formats and electronically share structured data via the public Internet, as well as via corporate networks.

        </p>
         <p>&nbsp;XML data is known as self-describing or self-defining, meaning that the structure of the data is embedded with the data, thus when the data arrives there is no need to pre-build the structure to store the data; it is dynamically understood within the XML. The XML format can be used by any individual or group of individuals or companies that want to share information in a consistent way.
